# Planner 2

Second attempt at creating an agenda. The [Planner](https://github.com/fillip1984/planner) proved to be too difficult to lay out items in a grid without overlaying. It was a clone attempt for Outlook and Google agendas

Switching over to Apple agenda clone. Like the look of it better anyway! Hopefully it isn't as difficult

# Resources

* [Planner](https://github.com/fillip1984/planner) - stealing a lot of code from here since pointer events weren't easy

* [COOLORS](https://coolors.co) - color scheme
